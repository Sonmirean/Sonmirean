- Hello there! You can call me @Sonmirean.
- I’m interested in studying various aspects of low-level game development, such as structure of engines,
- modern rendering techniques, realization of ingame physics, 3D modeling, texturing and much more.
- I have some experience in Java, while currently coding on C++.
- I’m currently learning Vulkan API with usage of GLFW, and practicing Blender modeling in free time.
